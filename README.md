# other_models
This repository contains projects that demonstrate some of my other modeling skills that were not included in bayesian_models, generalized_linear_models, or spatial_analysis repositories. Each folder contains the data, R code, LaTex file to generate the report, and the final pdf report. The projects in each folder are described below.

**dimension_reduction**

This project employs the Lasso shrinkage method and bootstrap confidence intervals to reduce the high dimensionality of the explanatory variables in the dataset. Multiple linear regression is then used to determine the malignancy scores of cancerous tumors based on gene expression. The analysis was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class.

**factor_analysis**

This project evaluates whether one factor to measure the subordination of women in the household is sufficient in representing its 11 subindicators. Path analysis is used to evaluate the causal theory, and confirmatory factor analysis is used to examine both a one-factor and two-factor approach. This analysis was was copmleted for a graduate-level multivariate statistical methods class.

**manual_linear_regression**

This project employs simple linear regression analysis, with summary statistics and appropriate diagnostics to test the model. The analysis is performed without use of the *lm* function in R, and is instead performed using the base linear algebra and matrices required to build a linear regression model. The model tests which comic book company, DC or Marvel, makes superhero movies with more popular characters. The analysis was completed for a graduate-level linear models class.

**missing_data_imputation**

This project employs multivariate normal imputation to fill in the missing values in a dataset on employee outcomes. Multiple linear regression is then used to analyze how employee productivity relates to their satisfaction and wellbeing. The analysis was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class.

**random_forest**

This project employs a random forest model to predict letters from hand-written content. The prediction is based on data where each letter has been verified by an individual. This analysis was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class, and was completed with a classmate who is credited in the report. 

**time_series**

This project analyzes how much customers save by purchasing solar panels for their homes and predicts how long it takes for customers to recoup the initial cost of solar panels. An AR(1) Gaussian process regression model is used to analyze the time series data. This analysis was completed for a graduate-level statistical learning class, and was completed with a classmate who is credited in the report.
